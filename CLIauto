To use the Heroku CLI's autocomplete --
  Via homebrew's shell completion:
    1) Follow homebrew's install instructions https://docs.brew.sh/Shell-Completion
        NOTE: For zsh, as the instructions mention, be sure compinit is autoloaded
              and called, either explicitly or via a framework like oh-my-zsh.
    2) Then run
      $ heroku autocomplete --refresh-cache
  OR
  Use our standalone setup:
    1) Run and follow the install steps:
      $ heroku autocomplete

Bash completion has been installed to:
  /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d
